## Starting the Band

Power the Barmband and wait for the animation to finish.
After a single green blink, you are good to go.

## Idle state

When all LEDs are off, the Barmband is idling.
You can now press the Button at any time when you want to be paired up with another user.

## Waiting state

After you requested a partner, the LEDs are pulsating while the Band is waiting.
This might take a while, depending on the activity of other users.

## Paired state

After you where assigned a partner, both Barmbands will light up in the same color.

If you want to abort the challenge, press the button on your band to return to the idle state.

When you found your partner, hold the top part of your band against the bottom part of their band or vice versa.
Having a little chat with them is optional, but highly recommended.

After the challenge is completed, both Barmbands will automatically return to the idle state.
