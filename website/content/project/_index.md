Barmband is a wearable wristband designed to gamify social interactions. The concept is driven by the often daunting task of starting conversations in bars and pubs, where socialising is the lifeblood. Barmband offers an innovative solution - a fun, engaging tool that acts as an icebreaker in these social environments.

Equipped with an LED strip, a microcontroller and a RFID reader, Barmband aims to offer challenges as a method of engaging strangers in conversation. The purpose of Barmband goes beyond initiating conversations - it guarantees the engagement of both parties, signifying an equal willingness to communicate.

The process of gamification through Barmband activities begins with individuals manually initiating a challenge on their Barmband. When activated, the Barmbands light up in a random color and pair up with another activated Barmband that emits the same color. The challenge encourages wearers to find their matching partner and engage in conversation by scanning each other's Barmbands. Each initiation of the challenge is done manually, preserving any ongoing conversations while allowing for as many iterations as desired.

The current status of the Barmband is visually indicated by the LED strip. If no other activated Barmband is found, the Barmband will display a pulsing pattern. This pattern is a signal that the device is searching for a compatible partner. In addition to the pulsing pattern, the Barmband has a number of other patterns that indicate the current status. For example, a solid color when a match has been found, encouraging the user to search for a stranger wearing a bracelet of the same color.

The use cases for Barmband extend beyond bars and pubs. Networking events where social activities are key, first week activities where new students want to bond, even large celebrations like weddings can benefit from this wear-and-play experience. Barmband brings strangers together and facilitates social interaction.

A unique feature of Barmband is the explicit option to opt into challenges after each discovery. This allows users to either continue their conversation with a particular partner, or take on a new challenge with someone else - a graceful exit from an uncomfortable conversation.

The process of interacting with Barmband is designed to be as seamless and uninterrupted as possible. The wireless technology ensures that the Barmbands will automatically detect and pair with each other the first time wearers meet and scan each other's Barmbands.

Barmband comes with a graphical user interface that displays all active Barmbands and their current status, helping event hosts to effectively manage the social dynamics of their event.

All the hardware components of Barmband are designed to fit inside a wristband. The Barmband consists of an ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU), an LED strip, a RFID reader and an embedded RFID tag.
