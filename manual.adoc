=== Flashing the software

We use https://platformio.org/[PlatformIO] to build and flash the software.
Please follow the instructions provided https://platformio.org/install/integration[here] to install PlatformIO.
We will assume that a working `PlatformIO Core` installation is available on your machine during the next steps.

- Get the source code from the https://gitlab.hs-flensburg.de/teaching/microcontroller-programmierung-wise-23-24/barmband git repository
- Create a copy of the `include/config_example.h` and name it `include/config.h`
- Edit this file to fit your needs, especially `WIFI_SSID`  and `WIFI_PASSWORD`
- Build and flash the software using
```shell
pio run --target upload
```
- You can view the serial output using
```shell
pio device monitor
```
